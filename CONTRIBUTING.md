# Code of Conduct
- **Think before you react.** If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding.

- **Ask questions, don't make demands.** ("What do you think about trying...?" rather than "Don’t do...!!!")

- **Don't insult.** Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb", "stupid"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.

- **Be explicit.** Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.

- **Don't use hyperbole.** ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing")

- **Use emoji to clarify tone.** (":sparkles::sparkles: Looks good :+1: :sparkles::sparkles:" rather than "Looks good.")

# Issues
**We are no longer using the GitHub Issue Tracker. Please use the [Wurst Feedback App](https://feedback.wurst-client.tk/) instead.**

# Pull Requests
> **Note:** There haven't been many Pull Requests yet, so these guidelines are mostly based on predictions rather than experience.

- [**Read the tutorial**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) if you have never forked a repository before.  
[![](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/bootcamp/Bootcamp-Fork.png)](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

- **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.

- **Pull in changes** from the original often so that you stay up to date. That way, when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.

- **Create a branch** for your edits.

- **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.

- **It’s best to test.** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.

- **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include visible differences. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.

- **Keep the style** of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.

# Commits

  - "Add feature" :white_check_mark: **good**

- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :bug: `:bug:` when fixing bugs
